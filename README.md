Flourish ~~is~~ will be a program to add some fancy extras to your music library - whether or not your player does anything with the extra metadata is not its concern (i.e your player needs to support this metadata for this to be useful to you).

(Planned) Feature Set
  - BPM detection, รก la [getsongbm.com](getsongbm.com) (or falls back to manual detection)
  - LRC/Lyrics, based on [the CU LRC Kodi plugin](https://github.com/ronie/script.cu.lrclyrics)
  - Mood(bar) mood files

## Get your tags right first!
This is meant to be in addition to any standard tagger that deals with "normal" tags like Artist, Title, etc. and there are plenty out there. In other words, if your tags are wrong, this will give you either nothing or the wrong thing entirely.
